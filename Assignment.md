## Code Analysis (5 points)

Examine the following code snippet:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUser = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const response = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
        setUser(response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchUser();
  }, [userId]);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!user) return <div>User not found</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Explain how useState and useEffect are used in this component. What would happen if the userId prop changes? How does this component handle loading states and errors?

## Coding Challenge (10 points)

Create a React component called `WeatherWidget` that fetches and displays the current weather for a given city. Use the OpenWeatherMap API (or any weather API of your choice). The component should:

1. Use useState to manage the weather data and loading state.
2. Use useEffect to fetch weather data when the component mounts and when the city changes.
3. Display loading state while fetching data.
4. Handle and display any errors that occur during the API call.
5. Display the temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather condition.

Bonus: Add a simple form that allows users to change the city, and ensure the weather data updates accordingly.
